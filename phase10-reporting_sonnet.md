# Sonnet – Phase 10 (Reporting/Alerts) – Superprompt

Goal: Expand reporting to margin analytics and add alerting engine.

Tasks:
1) Define cost vs price data points; calculate margins per project.
2) Add alert rules: expiring maintenances (T-14), double bookings, low stock < threshold.
3) Propose Grafana dashboards + OTLP spans for API endpoints.
4) Provide db indexes recommendations.
Output: SQL index scripts, alert rules config, dashboard.json, docs.
