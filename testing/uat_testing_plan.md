# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan for RentGuy Enterprise Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan for the RentGuy Enterprise Platform. The primary goal of this UAT is to ensure that the developed features meet the business requirements and are fully functional from an end-user perspective. The testing will involve 10 distinct personas, covering various roles and use cases within the platform.

## 2. UAT Objectives
*   Validate that all implemented features align with the defined business requirements.
*   Ensure the platform is stable, reliable, and performs as expected under various scenarios.
*   Identify any critical defects, usability issues, or discrepancies before production deployment.
*   Confirm that the user experience is intuitive and efficient for all persona types.

## 3. Scope of UAT
The UAT will cover the following key areas:
*   User Authentication and Authorization (Login, Logout, Role-based access)
*   Property Management (Listing, Editing, Deleting properties)
*   Tenant Management (Onboarding, Communication, Lease management)
*   Financial Management (Rent collection, Expense tracking, Reporting)
*   Maintenance Request Management (Submission, Tracking, Resolution)
*   Reporting and Analytics
*   Integration with external services (if applicable)

## 4. UAT Personas
To ensure comprehensive coverage, 10 distinct personas will be used for testing. Each persona represents a typical user role and will execute specific test scenarios relevant to their responsibilities.

## 5. Test Scenarios and Expected Outcomes
For each persona, detailed test scenarios will be developed, outlining the steps to be performed and the expected results. A template for test cases is provided below:

### Test Case Template
*   **Test Case ID:** [e.g., UAT-P01-001]
*   **Persona:** [e.g., P01 - Property Owner]
*   **Feature Area:** [e.g., Property Listing]
*   **Test Scenario:** [Brief description of the scenario]
*   **Pre-conditions:** [Any setup required before executing the test]
*   **Steps:**
    1.  [Step 1]
    2.  [Step 2]
    3.  [Step 3]
*   **Expected Result:** [What should happen if the test passes]
*   **Actual Result:** [To be filled during testing]
*   **Status:** [Pass/Fail]
*   **Comments/Defects:** [Any observations or defects found]

## 6. UAT Success Criteria
As per project requirements, the UAT will be considered successful if:
*   **100% Pass Rate:** All defined test cases for all 10 personas pass successfully.
*   **Zero Critical Failures:** No critical defects (e.g., system crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities, blocking functionality) are identified.
*   All identified non-critical defects are documented, prioritized, and a plan for their resolution is in place.

## 7. UAT Environment
*   **Environment:** Staging/Pre-production environment, mirroring the production setup.
*   **Data:** Realistic, anonymized test data will be used.
*   **Access:** Each persona will be provided with appropriate credentials and access rights.

## 8. UAT Schedule
[To be defined based on project timelines]

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities
*   **UAT Lead:** [Responsible for overall UAT planning, coordination, and reporting]
*   **Testers:** [The 10 personas, potentially played by internal team members or actual users]
*   **Development Team:** [Responsible for addressing defects identified during UAT]

## 10. Reporting and Defect Management
*   All test results and defects will be logged in a centralized system.
*   Defects will be prioritized (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and assigned to the development team.
*   Regular status meetings will be held to review progress and discuss defect resolution.

## 11. Sign-off
Upon successful completion of the UAT and resolution of all critical defects, the relevant stakeholders will sign off on the platform's readiness for production deployment.
