# Module Logic Audit

## Overview
This audit checks for front-end modules that existed as placeholders without any executable logic. The scan focused on the `src/stores` feature area because it wires the UI to backend data and should not contain empty facades.

## Batch Planning
| Batch | Scope | Files | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Batch 1 | Implement shared store factory helper and store index exports | `src/stores/storeFactory.ts`, `src/stores/index.ts` | âœ… Completed |

No additional empty modules were detected in the audited area (`find src -type f -empty`). Future scans can extend beyond the stores layer if new placeholder files are added.

## Evidence
- `src/stores/storeFactory.ts` now provides the generic `createStore` helper with subscription support.
- `src/stores/index.ts` now exposes the individual stores and shared helpers, replacing the previously empty file.
