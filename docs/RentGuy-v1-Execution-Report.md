# RentGuy-v1 Execution Report

_Last updated: 2024-06-14_

## Mission Alignment
- Establish a repeatable execution loop that ships onboarding, planner, crew, and billing improvements while respecting RentGuy's enterprise guardrails.
- Maintain platform health through proactive build/security gates and UX quality targets (Lighthouse â‰¥ 90, WCAG 2.2 AA, INP < 200 ms).
- Capture progress transparently for stakeholders across engineering, operations, and leadership.

## Status Snapshot
| Gate | Target | Current | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build & Security | CI lint, unit tests, dependency audit | _Not yet executed_ | Baseline tooling review pending.
| UX & Accessibility | Lighthouse (Perf/BP/SEO/Acc â‰¥ 90), WCAG 2.2 AA | _Not yet executed_ | Need to wire Playwright + axe sweep.
| Planner Stress | Overlapping bookings + crew conflict sims | _Not yet executed_ | Requires scenario definitions + fixtures.
| Privacy & Telemetry | PII-free analytics, consent banner | _Not yet executed_ | Instrumentation review outstanding.

## ðŸ”´ Build & Security Backlog
| Priority | Item | Owner | Status | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Refresh CI per `NEXT_CI_ACTIONS.md` (lint, Playwright, Lighthouse) | Platform Eng | Planned | Draft consolidated GitHub Actions workflow.
| P0 | Backend dependency vulnerability scan | Platform Eng | Planned | Run `pip-audit` baseline, create remediation list.
| P1 | Secrets handling review (`.env.example`, vault integration) | DevOps | Planned | Extract variables from `backend/app/core/config.py`.
| P1 | Alembic migration verification (0001-0006) | Backend | Planned | Dry-run migrations locally and validate schema drift.

## ðŸŸ  Feature & Test Backlog
| Priority | Item | Domain | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Onboarding flow completion (persona gating, inline errors) | Frontend | Planned | Audit `OnboardingOverlay.jsx` for missing states.
| P0 | Planner conflict detection (crew + transport overlap) | Backend/Frontend | Planned | Review `backend/app/routes/planner.py` (tbd) for validation hooks.
| P1 | Billing engine contract tests | Backend QA | Planned | Expand `tests` suite with fuzzed invoices.
| P1 | Analytics events for task completion | Frontend | Planned | Define `analytics.track` contract and data layer guardrails.
| P2 | Skeleton loaders for planner dashboard | Frontend | Planned | Hook into `Planner.jsx` suspense boundaries.

## ðŸŸ¢ UX & Documentation Backlog
| Priority | Item | Audience | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | NL localization audit (dates, currency, 24h clock) | UX | Planned | Ensure `storage.js` + UI components format per locale.
| P0 | Responsive breakpoints (360/768/1280) regression sweep | UX QA | Planned | Create Playwright viewport matrix.
| P1 | CHANGELOG + release notes automation | Docs | In Progress | Scaffolded initial changelog entry for execution loop.
| P1 | Empty states with CTA for planner panels | UX | Planned | Identify components lacking `EmptyState` fallback.

## Near-Term Deliverables (Sprint 0)
1. Confirm repo health: run backend `pytest`, frontend `npm run build`, baseline Lighthouse report.
2. Ship onboarding validation patch + NL localization fixes for planner dates.
3. Stand up CI workflow aligning with `NEXT_CI_ACTIONS.md` and publish results badge.

## Risk & Observations
- **Tooling Drift:** No unified CI currently ensures lint/tests; increases risk of regression. Address via GitHub Actions baseline.
- **A11y Debt:** Keyboard focus and screen reader support in planner not validated; must integrate axe + manual sweeps.
- **Data Integrity:** Crew/transport overlapping bookings currently unchecked; business-critical before go-live.

## Next Update
- Populate gate metrics after initial tooling run.
- Add execution burndown (completed vs planned backlog items).
- Link to QA artefacts (Playwright reports, Lighthouse scores, stress test logs).
