# Mobile App Evaluation for Crew and Customer Personas

## Executive Summary
- **Recommendation:** Build a React Native application with Expo for rapid cross-platform delivery while reusing existing TypeScript models.
- **Target Personas:** On-site crew leads, warehouse technicians, and VIP customers requiring live booking oversight.
- **Key Outcomes:** Offline-first scanning, push notifications for scheduling changes, and simplified booking approval flows.

## Requirements Analysis
| Persona | Primary Goals | Critical Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crew Lead | Track assignments, confirm arrivals, and capture incidents | Offline project checklist, GPS breadcrumb trail, instant photo uploads |
| Warehouse Technician | Validate equipment picklists and report damages | Barcode/QR scanning, batch damage reporting, integration with inventory module |
| VIP Customer | Monitor booking status and invoices | Read-only dashboards, secure document access, escalation chat |

## Technical Approach
1. **Framework:** React Native + Expo Router to align with the existing React codebase and reuse Zustand slices for state.
2. **Device Integrations:**
   - Camera access via Expo Camera for scanning and incident capture.
   - Background fetch for periodic sync with the FastAPI backend.
   - Secure storage module for JWT refresh tokens.
3. **Offline Strategy:**
   - SQLite persistence through Expoâ€™s SQLite adapter, mirroring the warehouse scanner cache structure.
   - Conflict resolution rules deferring to backend timestamps.
4. **Deployment:** Leverage Expo Application Services (EAS) for build pipelines and internal distribution while long-term preparing for managed app store releases.

## Roadmap & Effort
| Milestone | Duration | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & UX prototypes | 2 weeks | Persona interviews, low-fidelity wireframes, navigation flows |
| MVP build | 6 weeks | Authentication, booking dashboard, inventory scanning |
| Pilot rollout | 2 weeks | Internal crew testing, telemetry instrumentation, bug triage |
| Production hardening | 4 weeks | Offline conflict resolution, security review, app store readiness |

## Dependencies & Risks
- **API Coverage:** Requires stable mobile-friendly endpoints for projects, inventory, and booking modules.
- **Device Management:** Recommend adopting MDM policies for company-owned crew devices.
- **Security:** Implement device attestation and biometric unlock before accessing sensitive booking information.

## Success Metrics
- 95% of crew check-ins completed through the app within three months.
- Reduce equipment mis-picks by 40% via mobile scanning compared to paper workflows.
- Achieve >4.5/5 satisfaction score from pilot participants.
