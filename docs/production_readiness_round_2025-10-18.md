# Production Readiness Run Log — 18 October 2025

This log captures the first multi-agent execution round requested for completing the outstanding production-readiness tasks. Each subsection lists the agent focus, actions performed, observed blockers, and follow-up recommendations.

## Priority 1 Tasks

### Deploy to VPS using the documented runbook — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Reviewed `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` to confirm the steps for provisioning the Traefik + FastAPI stack.
- **Blocker:** The sandbox lacks access to the target VPS and production secrets, so no remote deployment or log capture is possible during this round.
- **Next step:** Coordinate with the infrastructure team to supply VPN credentials and secrets bundle before the next execution round.

### Execute Playwright E2E regression suite — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Installed npm dependencies (`npm install`) and invoked `npm run test:e2e`.
- **Observation:** The suite fails during the Playwright web server bootstrap because the existing specs rely on Cypress commands such as `cy.visit`, which Playwright cannot execute.
- **Next step:** Refactor the E2E specs to native Playwright syntax or run them via Cypress until migration is complete.

### Apply latest database migrations and seed data — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Reviewed Alembic configuration (`alembic.ini`) and attempted to prepare a migration run.
- **Blocker:** The configuration targets PostgreSQL at `db:5432`, which is unavailable in the sandbox. Running migrations would require a provisioned database or container runtime.
- **Next step:** Provide a Postgres instance (Docker or managed) and rerun `alembic upgrade head` followed by the seed scripts.

### Finalise environment variable configuration for new modules — **Complete**
- **Action:** Updated `.env.example` with the customer portal, recurring invoice, booking, and sub-renting variables highlighted in the production report to keep local environments in sync.
- **Outcome:** Variables now cover every module introduced in the production batch summary.

## Priority 2 Tasks

### Run integration tests across new and existing modules — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Executed `pytest` from the repository root.
- **Observation:** The command reports “no tests ran,” indicating that cross-module integration cases still need to be authored or exposed through the current test discovery pattern.
- **Next step:** Add integration tests under `backend/tests` and ensure pytest discovers them (for example by adjusting `pytest.ini` or package initialisers).

### Perform performance/load testing on new endpoints — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Skipped heavy load generation because k6/Locust tooling and staging endpoints are not accessible in the sandbox.
- **Next step:** Re-run once a staging environment is reachable, ideally from a CI agent equipped with the necessary tooling.

### Conduct a security audit of auth and RBAC layers — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Manual review postponed because active token issuers and production RBAC policies are unavailable locally.
- **Next step:** Schedule a dedicated security review session with the IAM stakeholders once staging endpoints are live.

### Schedule user acceptance testing with stakeholders — **Blocked**
- **Action:** Unable to send invitations or collect sign-off artifacts without stakeholder calendars and the latest release candidate.
- **Next step:** Coordinate with the product owner to secure availability and prepare UAT scripts once the deployment is staged.

## Priority 3 Tasks

### Evaluate mobile app opportunities for crew/customers — **Complete**
- **Action:** Drafted `docs/mobile_app_evaluation.md` summarising target personas, required offline features, and the preferred stack.

### Extend analytics for BI dashboards — **Complete**
- **Action:** Authored `docs/analytics_extension_plan.md` with proposed KPIs, event taxonomy, and tooling integration steps.

### Plan third-party accounting/CRM integrations — **Complete**
- **Action:** Documented `docs/integration_strategy.md` outlining priority systems, contract requirements, and sequencing.

### Prepare internationalisation roadmap — **Complete**
- **Action:** Created `docs/internationalization_roadmap.md` covering language tiers, localisation tooling, and release milestones.

## Follow-up Actions Raised This Round

1. Convert the Cypress-style E2E specs to native Playwright tests so that `npm run test:e2e` can succeed.
2. Provision an ephemeral PostgreSQL instance (Docker or managed) for running Alembic migrations and backend integration tests inside CI.
