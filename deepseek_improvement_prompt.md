# DeepSeek Implementation Prompt: RentGuy Enterprise Platform Codebase Improvements

**Goal:** Implement the 105 suggested improvements from the critical codebase analysis report for the RentGuy Enterprise Platform. The implementation should be performed across the FastAPI backend, React/Vite frontend, and Docker infrastructure.

**Context:**
The project is a monorepo structure with a FastAPI backend (`backend/`) and a React/Vite frontend (`rentguy/frontend/`). The deployment uses Docker and Traefik.

**Instructions:**
Implement the following 105 suggestions. For each suggestion, provide a brief summary of the change and the file(s) modified.

## I. Security and Configuration (20 Suggestions)

| ID | Suggestion |
| :--- | :--- |
| **S01** | **MUST** remove `JWT_SECRET: "change_me"` from `backend/app/core/config.py` and load it from an environment variable. |
| **S02** | Remove the default `DATABASE_URL` from `config.py` and enforce loading from an environment variable. |
| **S03** | Enforce a more modern and secure JWT algorithm like `HS512` or `RS256` instead of `HS256`. |
| **S04** | Restrict `allow_origins=["*"]` in `app/main.py` to a specific list of allowed frontend domains (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`, `https://rentguy.example.com`). |
| **S05** | Verify that a modern, slow hash function (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) is used for password storage. (Assume bcrypt is used in `auth/security.py` and ensure it's configured). |
| **S06** | Review `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (24 hours) and consider a shorter duration (e.g., 60 minutes) with a refresh token mechanism (if not already present). |
| **S07** | Implement a dedicated secret loading mechanism (e.g., using `pydantic-settings` with `.env` files for local dev and a vault for production). |
| **S08** | Implement stricter Pydantic validation for all incoming API payloads (e.g., email format, password strength). |
| **S09** | Implement rate limiting on all authentication and critical write endpoints (e.g., using `fastapi-limiter`). |
| **S10** | Ensure the application is deployed behind a reverse proxy (Traefik) that enforces HTTPS redirection for all traffic (Add Traefik middleware labels to `docker-compose.traefik.yml`). |
| **S11** | Confirm that all database interactions use parameterized queries (ORM like SQLAlchemy handles this). (Verification step). |
| **S12** | Add security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to all responses (via FastAPI middleware). |
| **S13** | Implement CSRF protection for state-changing requests, especially if using cookie-based authentication. (Verification/Placeholder). |
| **S14** | Integrate a tool like Dependabot or Snyk to continuously scan for vulnerable dependencies. (Documentation/Setup step). |
| **S15** | Ensure that API error responses do not leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, internal paths). (Verification/Refinement of `app_error_handler`). |
| **S16** | Implement granular permission checks within route dependencies, not just role checks. (Refinement of `auth/deps.py`). |
| **S17** | Implement secure rotation and revocation of API keys for external services (Stripe, Mollie). (Documentation/Placeholder). |
| **S18** | Ensure secure session ID generation, storage, and expiration. (Verification/Placeholder). |
| **S19** | Remove hardcoded API base URL from the frontend's `api.js` and inject it via environment variables (e.g., Vite's `import.meta.env`). |
| **S20** | Use a more robust feature flag system than simple boolean checks in `config.py` for `FEATURE_TRANSPORT` and `FEATURE_PAYMENTS`. (Refactor to use a dedicated feature flag service). |
