# Debug Report

## Timeline

- **2025-10-15 17:59 UTC** – Attempted `npm install`; failed with `npm ERR! code E403` because the
  execution environment cannot reach the npm registry.
- **2025-10-15 18:01 UTC** – Added debugging orchestrator scripts, smoke harness, and documentation
  to formalise the investigation workflow.
- **2025-10-22 18:43 UTC** – Successfully installed the Node.js toolchain with peer-dependency
  warnings, enabling the lint, type-check, build, and test commands to execute locally.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/lint.log†L1-L40】【F:artifacts/debug/logs/typecheck.log†L1-L38】
- **2025-10-22 18:46 UTC** – Reran `npm run debug:prepare`, `npm run debug:scan`, and
  `npm run debug:run` to refresh the debugging artefacts after the toolchain bootstrap.【F:DEBUG_SUMMARY.json†L1-L15】

## Key findings

1. **Lint violations across planner, CRM, and auth flows** – `npm run lint` now executes and
   reports 43 unused variables plus missing `await` expressions in the project store, signalling the
   need for targeted clean-up across UI modules.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/lint.log†L6-L63】
2. **Extensive TypeScript errors** – The compiler highlights missing exports, implicit `any`
   parameters, incorrect store access patterns, and missing type declarations (e.g. `uuid`) across
   Planner, Secrets Dashboard, marketing landing page, and health-check utilities.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/typecheck.log†L1-L54】
3. **Automated smoke checks fail** – Health probes against `localhost:3000` return network errors
   because supporting services are not running during the scan, leaving readiness validation
   blocked.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/smoke.log†L1-L8】【F:artifacts/debug/logs/smoke-results.json†L1-L22】
4. **Automated tests require harness fixes** – Vitest fails in the auth store tests (`vi.mock is not
   a function`), while Cypress cannot start due to the missing Xvfb dependency required for headed
   Electron runs in the sandbox.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/test.log†L1-L33】【F:artifacts/debug/logs/e2e.log†L1-L26】

## Next steps

- Address the unused-variable and `require-await` lint errors across planner, CRM, and auth
  components before rerunning `npm run lint` to confirm a clean baseline.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/lint.log†L6-L63】
- Triage the Planner, Secrets Dashboard, marketing page, and utility TypeScript errors, adding
  missing declarations (`@types/uuid`) and aligning store access patterns, then re-run
  `npm run typecheck`.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/typecheck.log†L1-L54】
- Stand up the API/frontend stack (or mock the endpoints) during the debug scan so that
  `npm run smoke` can validate `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez`, and `/` successfully.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/smoke-results.json†L1-L22】
- Update the Vitest suite to use supported mocking utilities and configure Cypress with a
  headless-Xvfb alternative (or install Xvfb) to stabilise automated test coverage.【F:artifacts/debug/logs/test.log†L1-L33】【F:artifacts/debug/logs/e2e.log†L14-L26】

## Rollback considerations

Changes introduced in this debugging session are limited to tooling, documentation, and metadata.
To revert, reset the repository to the previous commit:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Alternatively, remove individual files added or modified during this session if partial rollback is
preferred.
