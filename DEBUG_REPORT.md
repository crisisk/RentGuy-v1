# Debug Report

## Timeline

- **2025-10-15 17:59 UTC** – Attempted `npm install`; failed with `npm ERR! code E403` because the
  execution environment cannot reach the npm registry.
- **2025-10-15 18:01 UTC** – Added debugging orchestrator scripts, smoke harness, and documentation
  to formalise the investigation workflow.
- **2025-10-15 18:02 UTC** – Ran `npm run debug:prepare`, `npm run debug:scan`, and `npm run
  debug:run` to capture the current baseline.

## Key findings

1. **Dependency installation blocked** – All toolchain commands (`eslint`, `vitest`, `vite`,
   Playwright) are unavailable because packages cannot be downloaded from the npm registry. See
   `artifacts/debug/logs/lint.log`, `build.log`, `test.log`, and `e2e.log` for representative
   failures. Resolving this requires providing an accessible registry mirror or offline cache.
2. **TypeScript syntax error** – `src/ui/OnboardingOverlay.tsx` contains a syntax issue reported by
   the TypeScript compiler at line 984 (`Expression expected`). The file should be audited once the
   toolchain is available to ensure JSX/TypeScript syntax is valid.
3. **Health endpoint unreachable** – Smoke tests fail because the frontend/backend services are not
   running locally. After provisioning services, rerun `npm run smoke` to verify `/healthz`,
   `/readyz`, and `/livez` endpoints.

## Next steps

- Restore npm package access (preferred: configure npm to use an internal proxy accessible from the
  sandbox). Re-run `npm run debug:prepare && npm run debug:scan` afterwards to refresh artefacts.
- Fix the TypeScript syntax error in `src/ui/OnboardingOverlay.tsx` and re-run `npm run typecheck`.
- Start the development server (`npm run start:dev`) and rerun `npm run smoke` to validate health
  checks once dependencies are installed.

## Rollback considerations

Changes introduced in this debugging session are limited to tooling, documentation, and metadata.
To revert, reset the repository to the previous commit:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Alternatively, remove individual files added or modified during this session if partial rollback is
preferred.
