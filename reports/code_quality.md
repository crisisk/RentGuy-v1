# Code Quality Audit

## Overview
The RentGuy frontend focuses on an onboarding overlay, Planner timeline, and login surface. The codebase demonstrates strong visual styling but lacks persona-driven logic, security hardening, and modular structure needed for enterprise onboarding.

## Key Findings
1. **Static onboarding data** – `fallbackSteps` and `fallbackTips` embed generic Sevensa copy, which prevents persona-driven instructions when the API fails (`OnboardingOverlay.jsx` lines 6-52, 139-168). Dynamic content should degrade gracefully but still reflect role-specific tasks.
2. **Local storage session without expiry** – Session tokens are persisted in `localStorage` with no expiration or refresh, and logout triggers a full page reload instead of state reset (`App.jsx` lines 27-105). This complicates SSO/OIDC integration and can leak credentials.
3. **Shared demo credentials in production bundle** – The login form initializes with demo usernames/passwords and renders credential hints directly in the UI (`Login.jsx` lines 7-138). This is unsafe outside demo environments and blocks MFA adoption.
4. **Persona presets unused in UI** – Planner defines rich persona presets yet there is no visible selector or persistence wiring, limiting onboarding personalization (`Planner.jsx` lines 5-101). Users cannot discover role-specific filters.
5. **Accessibility gaps in onboarding modal** – Prior to this change the overlay lacked dialog semantics and keyboard escape handling. The new patch adds `role="dialog"`, focus management, and ESC support (`OnboardingOverlay.jsx` lines 110-213, 271-280), but additional trap logic is needed.
6. **Inline styling hampers theming and responsive tweaks** – Components rely on large inline style objects, making theme overrides, media queries, and dark mode support difficult (`Login.jsx` lines 41-198; `OnboardingOverlay.jsx` lines 271-399).
7. **Network controllers leak on repeated actions** – `controllersRef` collects `AbortController` instances yet there is no hard limit; long sessions could retain aborted controllers and hamper GC (`OnboardingOverlay.jsx` lines 109-190, 227-268). Clean-up should remove entries deterministically and guard against concurrency.
8. **Planner data pipeline lacks error states** – Planner imports `api` but has limited fallback for failed requests; loaders exist but no retry/empty-state CTA for inventory conflicts, affecting onboarding success.

## Top 10 Fixes with KPI Impact

## Suggested Engineering Next Steps
- Create typed client for onboarding endpoints with abort pooling and telemetry hooks.
- Introduce feature flag infrastructure (e.g., LaunchDarkly) to roll out persona-specific components safely.
- Extend Playwright coverage to include finance and warehouse flows.
