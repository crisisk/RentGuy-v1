I have successfully analyzed the available system reports and generated a comprehensive map of the VPS environment. The analysis reveals a significant number of services and port configurations, as well as several potential conflicts that we need to address.
Here is a summary of the key findings:
Services Identified:
origin-calculation-service (Python FastAPI)
certificate-generation-service (Python + ReportLab)
supplier-management-service (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
amf-integration-service (Python + REST API)
audit-trail-service (Node.js + TimescaleDB)
psra-frontend (Next.js)
psra-backend (Backend API)
psra-db (PostgreSQL)
psra-redis (Redis)
keycloak (Authentication)
nginx (Reverse Proxy)
prometheus (Monitoring)
grafana (Monitoring)
Port Usage and Potential Conflicts:
80, 443: Used by NGINX. This is standard, but we need to ensure proper routing to the new multi-tenant applications.
3000: Used by both the Next.js frontend and Grafana. This is a critical conflict that needs to be resolved.
5432: Used by PostgreSQL.
6379: Used by Redis.
8001, 4203: Used by the backend API.
8080: Used by Keycloak.
9090: Used by Prometheus.
Next Steps:
Based on this analysis, I will now create a detailed plan to reconfigure the environment for a multi-tenant setup. This will include:
Resolving the Port Conflict: I will assign a new port to either the Next.js frontend or Grafana to eliminate the conflict on port 3000.
Designing the NGINX Reverse Proxy: I will create a new NGINX configuration that routes traffic to the PSRA tool, the rentguy application (once I have more information), and any other services you plan to deploy.
Isolating Applications: I will create separate Docker Compose files for each application to ensure they are properly isolated and can be managed independently.
I am now ready to proceed with designing the multi-tenant architecture. Could you please provide the necessary details for the rentguy application so I can include it in the plan?
